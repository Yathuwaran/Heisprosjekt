\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
file \hyperlink{button__operations_8h}{button\+\_\+operations.\+h}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Includes funtions for setting and resetting the button lamps on the elevator panel. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \hyperlink{controller_8h}{controller.\+h}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em The controller file constists of two global structs for keeping track of the elevator status and the state of the elevator. Funtions for reseting, stopping, running, executing and initializing the elevator as well as functions for updtating the status and state are also included. The main logic of the elvator lies within the \hyperlink{controller_8h_a29eb4c73c46dfbbbe1c9f908b781192c}{run\+\_\+elevator()} function. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \hyperlink{door_8h}{door.\+h}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em The door file includes functions for opening and closing the door. There is also implemented a three second time delay for holding the door open. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \hyperlink{queue_8h}{queue.\+h}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em The queue file includes funtions used to manipulate the queue for the elevator, determine direction based on elements in queue and check if the queue is empty. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
